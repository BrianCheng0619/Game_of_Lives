modified game of life rules:

There are two sides, white and red:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two same color live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.

2. Any live cell with two or three same color live neighbors survives to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three same color live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three same color live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


Additional rules for the two-player variant:

5. If an empty cell is surrounded by three white neighbors and three red neighbors, its state remains unchanged.

6. If a red cell is surrounded by three white neighbors, it switches its color to white.

7. If a white cell is surrounded by three red neighbors, it switches its color to red.
